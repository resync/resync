"""ResourceSync ChangeList object

A ChangeList is a list of resource descriptions which includes
both metadata associated with the resource at some point in
time, and also metadata about a change that may have occurred
to bring the resource to that states. These descriptions
are Resource objects.

Different from an resource_list, a change_list may include multiple
descriptions for the same resource. The change_list is ordered
from first entry to last entry. 

Different from an resource_list, dereference by a URI yields a 
ChangeList containing descriptions pertaining to that 
particular resource.
