"""ResourceSync Resource List object.

A Resource List is a set of resources with some metadata for
each resource. Comparison of resource lists from a source and
a destination allows understanding of whether the two are in
sync or whether some resources need to be updated at the
destination.

There may also be metadata about the Resource List, and links
to other ResourceSync documents. Metadata include the
timestamp of the Resource List (md_at) and, optionally, the
timestamp when creation of the Resource List was completed
(md_completed).at the top level. These include a creation timestamp
(from) and links to the Capability List.

    This same class is used for both the source and the destination
    and is the central point of comparison the decide whether they
    are in sync or what needs to be copied to bring the destinaton
    into sync.

    A ResourceList will admit only one resource with any given URI.

    Typical usage for a small ResourceList is:

        rl = ResourceList()
        rl.add( Resource(...) )
        rl.add( Resource(...) )
        print rl.as_xml()

    The default storage is unordered but the iterator imposes a canonical
    order which is alphabetical by URI. If it is desired to have
    resources listed in the order they are added then the ResourceDictOrdered
    class may be specified on creation:

        rl = ResourceList( resources_class=ResourceDictOrdered )

    In normal use it is expected that any Resource List Index will be
    created automatically when writing out a large Resource List in
    multiple sitemap files. However, should it be necessary to
    explicitly create an index then this may be specified with:

        rli = ResourceList( resources_class=ResourceDictOrdered )
        rli.sitemapindex=True
